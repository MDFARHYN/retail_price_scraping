# üõí Automate Retail Price Monitoring with a Python Scraper

## üìñ Introduction

Manually tracking prices on large e-commerce sites like Amazon and Walmart can be overwhelming due to their frequent price changes. This Python script provides an automated solution for retail price monitoring, saving time and minimizing human errors.

## üöÄ Purpose

This tool is designed to:
- **Monitor** prices of various products automatically.
- **Track** price changes over time.
- **Send alerts** when there is a significant price drop.

## üõ† Tools and Libraries

To implement this system, you'll need the following libraries:

- **BeautifulSoup** ü•£: For parsing HTML and extracting price data.
- **Requests** üì°: To make HTTP requests and download web page content.
- **Pandas** üêº: For data manipulation and organizing the scraped data.

Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas lxml
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Send HTTP Requests** üåê: Uses the `Requests` library to download HTML content from target websites.
2. **Parse HTML** üìù: BeautifulSoup extracts the specific price elements from the HTML.
3. **Store Data** üóÉÔ∏è: Saves the extracted price data into a CSV file for future analysis.
4. **Send Alerts** üìß: Notifies via email when the price falls below a specified threshold.

## üìÑ Code Overview

- **`save_to_csv(url, price)`**: Saves the scraped price data with the date and URL into a CSV file.
- **`send_email()`**: Sends an alert email when the monitored price drops below a certain amount.
- **`check_and_notify()`**: Checks the price against the defined threshold and calls `send_email()` if the condition is met.

## üö® Usage Instructions

1. **Configure Proxy (Optional)** üõ°Ô∏è: Set up a proxy to avoid IP blocking when scraping frequently.
2. **Run the Script** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è: Execute the Python script to begin monitoring.
3. **Set Up Email Alerts** üì¨: Follow the provided steps to configure SMTP for sending email notifications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

- Follow website **Terms of Service (ToS)** and check the `robots.txt` file before scraping.
- Avoid overloading servers by adding delays between requests.
- Ensure compliance with **data protection regulations** like GDPR when scraping personal data.
